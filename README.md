# Abstract
This study investigated the potential impact of a motor skill proficiency barrier on measures of
cardiorespiratory (CRF) and musculoskeletal (MSF) fitness in youth. A sample of 241 youth (114
girls) aged 10 - 18 years, completed the Motor Competence Assessment battery with composite
scores indexed according to age- and gender-adjusted percentile scores. Motor competence
(MC) levels were categorized as low (≤ 25<sup>%tile</sup> – proficiency barrier), moderate (≥ 26<sup>%tile</sup> to < 75<sup>%
tile</sup>), and high (≥ 75<sup>%tile</sup>). CRF levels (Health Risk, Needs Improvement, and Healthy) were
assessed using the Fitnessgram® 20 m PACER test. Low (≤ 20<sup>%tile</sup>), moderate (≥ 21<sup>%tile</sup> to ≤ 80<sup>%
tile</sup>), and high (≥ 80<sup>%tile</sup>) MSF levels were assessed using grip strength normative data. Two 3 × 3
chi-square tests were conducted to determine the probability of MC level predicting CRF and
MSF levels. Results demonstrated statistically significant models for performance on both the
PACER (χ<sup>2</sup>[4, N = 241] = 22.65, p < .001) and grip strength (χ<sup>2</sup>[4, N = 241] = 23.95, p < .001). Strong
evidence of a proficiency barrier impacting CRF was noted, as no low skilled youth met the
“Healthy” fitness zone standards for PACER performance. Evidence supporting a barrier with
grip strength was not as strong, as 20.8% of youth exhibiting low MC displayed high grip
strength. However, all individuals with high levels of MC demonstrated at least moderate grip
strength. Results emphasize the importance of developing MC during childhood as it may
provide a protective effect against unhealthy CRF and MSF across youth.

# Highlights
- These data support the notion of Seefeldt’s (1980) proficiency barrier as it relates to CRF, as no
youth demonstrating low MC met the healthy fitness zone criteria for PACER performance. The
development of MC may both directly and indirectly provide a protective effect against
unhealthy CRF levels across childhood and adolescence.  
- Evidence supporting a proficiency barrier with MSF as measured by grip strength was not as
strong; however, all individuals with high levels of MC demonstrated at least moderate grip
strength. Thus, the development of MC may be a protective factor to mitigate low levels of
MSF via enhanced neuromuscular function.  
- Promoting the development of MC in a variety of developmentally appropriate activities and
settings (e.g. MC skills practice, structured and unstructured play, and performance contexts)
is important to promote positive trajectories of CRF and MSF across childhood and adolescence.
